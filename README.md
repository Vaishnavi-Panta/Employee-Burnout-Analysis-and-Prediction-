# Employee-Burnout-Analysis-and-Prediction
PROBLEM  STATEMENT
Accurate prediction provides a number of important benefits for research and decision-making. The Employee burnout in any organization is a common problem now a days due to multi tasking roles in order to increase the productivity. The prediction of Employee Burnout requires methods that can deal with large amounts of data. For this purpose, this project work presents insights into machine learning methods, mainly related to prediction tasks based on gender, designation, work from home setup available, mental fatigue score
The main objective of the present project work  is to analyze and predict the employee burn rate based on the features such as Gender, Company Type, WFH available, Designation, Resource allocation, mental Fatigue score.  In the analysis part of the project work the Principal Component Analysis is carried out to find the important features which affect the burn rate of employees. In prediction part of the project work, two important machine learning models namely RandomForest regressor and Adaboost regressor were used to predict the  percentage of accuracy of prediction of burn rate.

The following steps are involved in the  machine learning application of the present project work:
Collecting the data : The data set is saved in the google drive and imported into google colab.
Preparing the data :  Cleaning the data to remove unwanted data, missing values,null values, rows, and columns,  duplicate values, data type conversion, etc. 
Choosing a model : It is important to choose a model which is relevant to the task at hand. As the employee 
      burn rate is increasing steadily in the data set, hence regression models are chosen in the project work.
Training the model :Training is the most important step in machine learning. A machine learning training model is a process in which a machine learning (ML) algorithm is fed with sufficient training data to learn from. In the project work 75% of data taken as training data and the 25% of data is taken as test data.
Testing the model: When used on testing data, we get an accurate measure of how the model will perform.
Making predictions:. At the end of the project, two ML models are used  to make predictions accurately.
